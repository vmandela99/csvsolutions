<div id="types-of-databases" class="section level3">
<h3>Types of Databases</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Flat files</li>
<li>Non relational databases</li>
<li>Relational databases</li>
</ol>
<div id="flat-files" class="section level4">
<h4>Flat files</h4>
<p>Flats files are databases that store data in plain files. Each data record is separated by delimiters such as commas, tabs, etcs. The benefit of using flat files is their simplicity. But when building an application you often need more flexibility which is where a database management system comes in handy.</p>
<div id="database-management-systems" class="section level5">
<h5>Database Management Systems</h5>
<p>Data management systems are software that handle the storage, retrieval and updating of data. The common data management systems are:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-relational databases (NoSQL)</li>
<li>Relational database (SQL)</li>
</ul>
<p>SQL stands for structured query language, which is a language that makes it possible to easily manage the requested data.</p>

<h4>Non-Relaional Database (NoSQL)</h4>
<p>Non-relational databases are used to store data that has minimal structure like image data. Non-relational databases can store data as a key:value pair. Some examples of non-relational database systems are;-</p>
<ul>
<li>MongoDB</li>
<li>Couchbase</li>
<li>Amazon DynamoDB</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="relational-database-sql" class="section level4">
<h4>Relational database (SQL)</h4>
<p>In a relational database for example one can have different tables for customer information, billing information and image uploaded. With relational database and one SQL command we you are able to pull all that information across all the tables which could not be as easily accomplished as a non-relational database. Some examples of relational database manaagement systems are;-</p>
<ul>
<li>PostgresSQL</li>
<li>MSSQL</li>
<li>MySQL</li>
</ul>
